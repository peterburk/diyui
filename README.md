iUI is an excellent piece of software for iPhone development. Web apps can be created and deployed more rapidly than the App Store, and are inherently cross-platform. But you still have to code HTML.

For a very basic iPhone app, you just need a folder structure with links, similar to your Safari bookmarks.

Enter diyUI: your first cross-platform iUI code generator. Tested and working on Mac OS 10.6 and jailbroken iOS 3.2, this shell script makes editing an iUI site as simple as changing a folder.

Thatâ€™s right: code generation on the iPhone itself. It completes the circle of iPhone-Web-iPhone.

For inexperienced users on Mac OS, Folder to iUI is an equivalent program written in AppleScript. Simply drag-and-drop a folder onto the program, and an index.html file will be generated.
